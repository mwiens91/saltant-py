======================================

saltant-py is a Python SDK for `saltant`_. It lets you perform any
action possible on the saltant API (some much more conveniently) within
the comforts (hopefully) of Python. As a refresher, you might want to
look at `saltant's API reference`_ to see what actions are possible.
